# Where do we need more parks in Los Angeles?

## Group Members - The Park (Power) Rangers

In keeping with our Power Rangers theme, **Leslie Velasquez** will play the role of  a new color ranger, the Orange Ranger :orange_heart:, and **Carolyn Chu** takes on the classic title of the Pink Ranger :two_hearts:. While the classic Mighty Morphin Power Rangers focused on fighting evil space alien villains (s/o to Rita Repulsa), this pair of Park Power Rangers fights for :zap: social justice and racial equity :zap:, specifically in park planning and provision. Leslie will focus mainly on our analysis of census race data as it relates to LA parks. Carolyn will focus on analyzing the houshold income data. We plan on working on park maps and the research narrative together. *It's morphin' time!*

## Status update: Report on the general mood of the team, and provide details as to what is working, and what is not.
The general mood of the team is apprehensive but excited. We're still getting used to coding and are figuring out how to apply what weâ€™re learning in class to our project. We think the scope of the project is clear and straightforward. We're glad to have concrete data sources which will allow us to focus on the actual coding tasks and not worry about missing data.

## Data Update
We're using data from LA City's Data Portal and Census Reporter's American Community Survey (ACS) data. All of our data are available as geojson files.

1. *LA City Recreation and Parks Information* [Link](https://data.lacity.org/Parks-Recreation/Recreation-and-Parks-Information/rwq7-yhp5)
2. *Census Reporter's ACS 5-Year Estimates 2015-2019 for:*
      - *Population* [Link](https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B01003&geo_ids=16000US0644000,140|16000US0644000&primary_geo_id=16000US0644000)
      - *Median Household Income in the Past 12 Months* [Link](https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B19013&geo_ids=16000US0644000,140|16000US0644000&primary_geo_id=16000US0644000)
      - *Race* [Link](https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B02001&geo_ids=16000US0644000,140|16000US0644000&primary_geo_id=16000US0644000) 

## Concerns

**Major Concerns:**
Our major concerns mostly relate to spatial analysis processes that we don't know how to do yet, including: 
- a spatial join between our park data and census tract data
- selecting or clipping individual census tracts, for example, only clipping census tracts that fall in a 1/2 mile from any given park

**Minor Concerns:**
In speaking with Yoh during office hours, we learned that it's possible all of LA city is served by parks so our research question is moot. If we find out this is true, we'll need to think about how we'll pivot the research question. We put this under minor concerns since we know there are still disparities in park provisions or amenities. We'll just need to whittle our question down a bit more.
