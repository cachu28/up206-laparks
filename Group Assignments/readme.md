# Park Project Proposal
## Where do we need more parks in Los Angeles?
### Introduction

The City of Los Angeles is one of the most park poor cities in the nation, ranking 71st in the [Trust For Public Land's ParkScore assessment of 100 U.S. cities](https://www.tpl.org/city/los-angeles-california). Though 64% of the population lives within a 10-minute walking distance of a park, this statistic does not represent the inequities in park access across the city. Low-income neighborhoods of color, and specifically Black neighborhoods, have the least amount of park space per person -- almost 200% less than white neighborhoods! 

When residents live about a 10-minute walking distance, or 1/2 mile spatially, from parks, they are more likely to visit and use them for physical activity. Given the extensive research that describes LA parks as inequitably serving residents across race and socioeconomic lines, we plan to identify neighborhoods with the most need for parks based on park distance and population density, then prioritize which areas would benefit the most according to socioeconomic, race, and ethnicity demographics. Thus, through spatial analysis, we hope to answer the question: Where do we need more parks in Los Angeles?

### Why this matters

Parks and open space offer multiple health benefits to communities: people who live closer to parks are more likely to have better mental and physical health as well as stronger social ties. Quality parks are fundamental to sustaining healthy and equitable communities. This research question will use data to understand the interplay of public urban space with race and socioeconomic status.

### Spatial scope

This research question intends to focus on the city of Los Angeles. This scope has been selected because the city contains a large number of census tracts that represent a breadth of diversity across income, race/ethnicity, and density. This scope also lends itself to inform recommendations for policy and other urban planning processes at the city level of jurisdiction. Additionally, the city's park dataset has a sample size of 560 urban parks that serves its 4 million residents. The Recreation and Parks data also provides adequate variation in types of parks, including neighborhood pocket parks to larger urban wilderness parks.

### Data

This research project will use data from LA City's Data Portal and Census Reporter's American Community Survey (ACS) data. The data from LA City is available as a geojson and includes all parks and recreation centers maintained, operated, and owned by the LA City Recreation and Parks Department. In terms of census data, we will use 5-year estimates (2015-2019) for population, median household income, and race.

### Intended analysis and visualizations

This project will explore 1/2 mile buffers around LA's parks to understand which LA neighborhoods are served by a specific park. We can overlay this buffer analysis over maps displaying population density, race, and income. Given the geographic scope, we may zoom in to particularly dense areas such as Downtown Los Angeles, South LA, and Koreatown to gain a better understanding at the neighborhood level.

Visualizations to be produced include: a map with LA parks and 1/2 mile buffer, and maps showing population density, race/ethnicity, and median household income. We could also create a visualization showing the number of parks in white majority neighborhoods versus BIPOC majority neighborhoods ([like this](https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Warehouse1.jpg)). 

*Note from Carolyn: To leverage the work produced in this course with the work needed for my Applied Planning Research Project, I also plan to create maps that zoom into neighborhoods surrounding Lafayette Park in the Westlake neighborhood. My client project is about creating gender-inclusive parks in Los Angeles and uses Lafayette Park as a case study.*

### Conclusion
Parks and open space have benefits for our individual and community health (and even moreso during the COVID-19 pandemic). Yet, we know that these critical benefits are inequitably received across communities, especially in Los Angeles. Through gaining an understanding of where LA parks are located and who they serve, this research project intends to understand where LA parks *should* be in order to serve residents with the most need.
